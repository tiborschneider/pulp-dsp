/**
  @defgroup MatAddStride Strided Matrix Addition
  This module contains the glue code for strided matrix addition. The kernel codes (kernels) are in
  the Module strided matrix addition Kernels.

  The Matrx Addition adds two matrices, element wise. Both matrices, and the output matrix have
  dimension MxN.

      `pDst[m, n] = pSrcA[m, n] + pSrcB[m, n]`

  For strided operations, the implementation is an optimized version of the following code:

      for (int m = 0; m < M; m++) {
          for (int n = 0; n < N; n++) {
              pDst[m * strideY + n] = pSrcA[m * strideA + n] + pSrcB[m * strideB + n];
          }
      }

  There are functions for integer 32- 16- and 8-bit data types, as well as for floating-point. These
  functions can also be used for fix-point matrices, if they have their fix-point at the same
  location. The outpt matrix will then also have the fix-point at the same location.

  The naming scheme of the functions follows the following pattern (for example
  `plp_mat_add_stride_i32`):

      `plp_<function name>_<data type><precision>[_parallel]`

  name          | description
  ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------
  function_name | `mat_add_stride`
  data type     | {f, i, q} respectively for floats, integers, fixed points
  precision     | {32, 16, 8} bits

  The `strideX` argument tells how many elements are in between the start of each row of the matrix.
  In other words, it is the width of the original matrix. @ref groupMatrixStride
